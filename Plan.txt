### Here is general plan for the project.
1. Setting up services on Windows/Linux OS
2. Making it secured using Open-Sourced Applications
3. Set up some IDS, IPS software
4. Write rules that will create alerts for suspicious behaviors
5. Set up a SIEM to collect all the necessary logs
6. Test my security solutions in the wild, by crystal clear boxing it (Kind of penetraion test)
7. Patch the vulnerabilities I found


#### If everything works, then:
1. Try to create models for detecting suspicios behaviors of the system using Machine Learning system → Sending Syslog logs to it,
and it detects if something should be categorized as normal or the other way around
2. Set up a mail service, and creating SPAM filter for it → Using Machine Learning
